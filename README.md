# Task_3
basic page that displays multiple recommendations retrieved from an API endpoint and
displayed in the page.
The code must satisfy the following requirements:
1. A JavaScript Class should be used
2. It must use the endpoint https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity
3. The endpoint must be called asynchronously
4. The call must return a Promise
5. Multiple activities should be displayed on the page


The *bored API is bit slow to respond, you should wait for the results to be display after clicking the show more button
